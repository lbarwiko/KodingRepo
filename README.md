The Average Joes
================

# We are a group of highschool friends who are all freshmen at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, this fall.
  All four of us took introductory level programming courses this fall, and most of us aren't so experienced in any form of web development.
  We see this as a unique challenge that will be very difficult for all of us.  
  As kids we really loved playing Sim City 2000, which led us to Sim Ant for the Super Nintendo.
  We thought that the original version of Sim Ant could use some improvement, so we are going to try to improve upon it.
  

## The Members
 - Luke Barwikowski: I have the most experience out of the group with web languanges, and that's the scary thing. I've dabbled in webdesign as a hobby, but see a future career in the backend parts of web applications. I will be leading this team, and hopefully I can teach these guys a thing or two and we'll make an awesome project.
 - Lyle Antieau: I don't know a lot about programming, but I really enjoy the challenge that it brings. I hope we can make a great application for this hackathon enjoy the challenges that we face.
 - Nick Martinelli: I've taken a huge interest in programming lately. I don't really know much about anything, but I'm really excited for this.
 - Joseph Lafayette: I'm a huge nerd and I just started getting into programming.   My friends tell me that I have a knack for it. I hope I can be an essential part of this team.
 
 ## Our Plan
 We plan on using the Phaser game engine to implement our code.
 The engine is run through javascript on html5.
 Phaser is most commonly used to write code for games in an simple way.
 As we are still new to coding, we thought it would be a good idea to start with the Phaser game engine.
